# TRILLO

Wellcome to my Portfolio!

This website was designed by Jonas Schmidtmann. The Project is allowed to be used as part of student's portfolio.


###
This website was written using React.js and SCSS technologies.
It was originally built using HTML and as part of my studies I rewrited it using React. 
The website has almost no functionality! It's all about CSS and SCSS features .
